# tinyra1n
Tiny Core Linux running checkra1n!(ideally)



Just enough Linux to run checkra1n! Wait, I heard that somewhere... In the project which is almost 500MB of size!

Introducing tinyra1n: really JUST ENOUGH LINUX, since I don't know smaller checkra1n distro.

Written in nano!

Build:
execute build.sh as root. It will fetch checkra1n and tiny core linux and repackage it.
After script execution succeeds, the output.iso appears in tinyra1n directory. Please clone tinyra1n in your home directory, cause I love hardcoding stuff!

Run:
Prebuilts are not available until i FULLY test it. I don't want to harm you!

tinyra1n come with no warranty.
Built using tiny core linux and checkra1n.
